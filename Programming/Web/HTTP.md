Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol for transmitting data - be it HTML pages, images and other embed files - between the client and the server. It runs on a request-response model, where the client sends a request call to the server, and the server responds with appropriate message/data or an error. HTTP is stateless, which means it doesn't need to know what he current state of the client and responds to each request independently, without the knowledge of the previous requests.
